My simulation involves two "Knight" objects attacking each other and gradually reducing each other's health.

Each time the "Attack" function is run, a random number between 1-10 (inclusive) is rolled to see if the attack lands. If the number rolled is higher than
the value of the "target" parameter's speed variable, the target's health variable is reduced by the value of the "attacker" parameter's power variable.

The enemy and the player will attack each other at the same time. In order to initiate an attack, press the button labeled "Attack". To reset the
simulation, press the button labeled "Reset".
